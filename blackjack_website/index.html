            <p>
                The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over it. You win if you have a hand higher than the dealer's while being below 21,
                you win. If you exceed 21, you "bust", meaning you automatically lose.

                <h3>There are three moves:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hit: Recieve a new card</li>
                    <li>Stand: Keep your current hand</li>
                    <li>Split: Split two identical cards into two separate hands</li>

                    <li>The dealer hands a card face-up to you player and a card face-down for themselves.</li>

                    <li>You decide if you want to STAND or HIT. You may hit as many times as you want (as long as you don't go over 21)</li>
                    <li>The dealer flips his first card. If their total is 16 or less, they must hit. Otherwise, they stand.</li>
                    <li>Determine payouts depending on cards.</li>

                    <li>If your hand is worse, you lose the money you betted.</li>
                    <li>If your hand and the dealer's have the same value (including 21), the dealer PUSHES, meaning you just get your bet back.</li>
                    <li>If you get a blackjack and the dealer doesn't, you get paid out 3:2 (If you bet 2 chips, you get 3 on top of that, totalling to 5 chips)</li>
